# Problem:
- Graph Problem - find shortest Path from left-upper corner to right-lower corner

Things to solve (Components):
    - Data Input retrieval (Array, File-based)
        - create Graph class from input
    - Data Structure (Nodes, Array) - Graph Class
        - adjacent matrix
        - adjacent list (less memory intensive) 
    - Algorithm
        - might use different data structures (space is traded for speed)
            - use Graph Class
        - type:
            - single-source between only two vertices
            - weighted graph (no negatives)
            - directed graph
            - cyclic / acyclic (to be solved)
                - cyclic -> Dijkstra
                - acyclic -> topological sort algorithms
    - result output:
        - draw file with path drawn into
